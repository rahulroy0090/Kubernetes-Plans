## What are the basic components of Docker?



<li> Docker is an open-source centralized platform designed to create, deploy, and run applications. </li>

<li> Docker uses containers on the host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.</li> 

<li>
 We can install Docker on any OS, but the Docker engine runs natively on Linux distributions.
</li> 

<li>
Docker is written in the 'Go' language. 
</li>

<li>
Docker is a tool that performs OS-level virtualization, also known as containerization. 
</li>

<li>
Before Docker, many users faced the problem that a particular code was running on the developer's system but not on the user's system. 
</li>

<li>
Docker was first released in March 2013. It is developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Pahl.
</li>

<li>
 Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service that uses OS-level virtualization, whereas VMware uses hardware-level virtualization."
</li>

<h4> Advantages of Docker: </h4>

<li> No Pre-allocation of RAM </li> 

<li>CI Efficiency -> Docker enables you to build a container image and use that same image across every step of the deployment process. </li>

<li>Less cost</li>
<li>It is lightweight.</li>


<li>
 It can run on physical hardware, virtual hosts, or in the cloud.
</li> 

<li>
You can reuse the images.
</li>

<li>
It takes very little time to create a container. 
</li>


<h4>Disadvantages of Docker:</h4>

<li>
Docker is not a good solution for applications that require a rich GUI. 
</li>

<li>
Difficult to manage a large amount of containers. 
</li>

<li>
Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility. This means if an application is designed to run in a Docker container on Windows, then it cannot run on Linux or vice versa. 
</li>

<li>
Docker is suitable when the development OS and testing OS are the same, or if the OS is different, we should use the same. 
</li>

<li>
No solution for data recovery and backup. 
</li>

<h4>
Components of Docker:
 </h4>

<h5>Docker Daemon:</h5> 
Docker daemon runs on the Host OS.
It is responsible for running containers and managing Docker services.
Docker daemon can communicate with other daemons.

<h5>Docker Client:</h5> 
Docker users can interact with the Docker daemon through a client (CLI).
Docker client uses commands and REST API to communicate with the Docker daemon.
When a client runs any server commands on the Docker client terminal, the client terminal sends these Docker commands to the Docker daemon.
It is possible for the Docker client to communicate with more than one daemon.

<h5>Docker Host</h5> 

Docker host is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications.
It contains the Docker daemon, images, containers, networks, and storage.

<h5>
Docker Hub/Registry: 
</h5>

Docker registry manages and stores the Docker images.
There are two types of registries in Docker.
Public Registry: Public Registry is also called Docker Hub.
Private Registry: It is used to share images within the enterprise.

<h5>Docker Images: </h5>


Docker images are the read-only binary templates used to create Docker containers.
Single files with all dependencies and configurations required to run a program.
Ways to create images:
Take images from Docker Hub.
Create images from a Dockerfile.
Create images from an existing Docker container.

<h5> Docker Containers: </h5>

Containers hold the entire package that is needed to run the application.
In other words, we can say that the image is a template and the container is a copy of that template.
A container is like a virtual machine.
Images become containers when they run on the Docker engine.




---------------------------------------------------------------------







<p>Docker is defined as a freemium platform as a service (PaaS) solution that aids in creating, operating, and maintaining containers for isolated software development and testing by creating a virtualized operating system (OS) environment. </p>

## 8 Key Components of Docker.

<h4> 1. The Docker Engine </h4>

<li> Server: The Docker daemon (dockerd) is in charge of creating and managing containers. </li>
<li> Rest API: The Rest API enables the communication between applications and Docker and gives Dockerd instructions. </li>
<li> Command Line Interface (CLI): Docker commands are executed using the CLI. </li>


<h4> 2. Docker images </h4>

<h4> 3. Dockerfile </h4>

<h4> 4. The Docker Hub </h4>

<h4> 5. Docker volumes </h4>

<h4> 6. Docker Compose </h4>

<h4> 7. Docker Desktop </h4>

<h4> 8. Docker containers <h4>



## Difference between containerization and virtual machines.


<h4> Virtual machine </h4>

<li> Heavyweight </li>
<li> Limited performance </li>
<li> Each VM runs in its own OS. </li>
<li> Hardware-level virtualization </li>
<li> Startup time in mintues </li>
<li> Allocates required memory </li>
<li> Fully isolated and hence more secure </li>


<h4>Container </h4>

<li> Lightweight</li>
<li>Native performance </li>
<li> All containers share the host OS </li>
<li> OS virtualization</li>
<li>Startup time in milliseconds </li>
<li>Requires less memory space</li>
<li> Process-level isolation, possibly less secure</li>

 

## Why do we use containerization?

<p> Software developers use containerization to deploy applications in multiple environments without rewriting the program code. They build an application once and deploy it on multiple operating systems. For example, they run the same containers on Linux and Windows operating systems. </p>

## How Docker storage and networking work.



## What is runtime in containerization and what are the types in containerization?



## Difference between low-level and high-level runtime in containerization.



## Difference between Podman and Docker and how Podman manages containers.



## How to run a rootless Podman container and how it functions.
<p>
Customize how you run containers in Podman by changing the user namespace while in rootless mode. By default, rootless Podman containers map the user's user ID (UID) into the container as root of the user namespace.
</p>

<p> 
Customize how you run containers in Podman by changing the user namespace while in rootless mode. By default, rootless Podman containers map the user's user ID (UID) into the container as root of the user namespace. </p>

<p>
The basic syntax for running a command inside a container is: podman exec [options] [container-name] [command [args â€¦]] The -ti option attached a virtual console and starts an interactive session </p>


## How Kubernetes runs containers and pods.
<p> 
Each node in a Kubernetes cluster runs the containers that form the Pods assigned to that node. Containers in a Pod are co-located and co-scheduled to run on the same node. </p>


## What are OCI, CRI, and CRI-O?

<h4>> OCI (Open Container Initiative): </h4>
<p>
<li> OCI is an open-source project that aims to create industry standards for container formats and runtime. </li>
<li> It defines two specifications: the Image Specification and the Runtime Specification. </li>
<li> Image Specification: Describes the format of the container image, including the filesystem layout and metadata. </li>
<li> Runtime Specification: Defines the requirements for a container runtime that can execute the container image. <li>
<li> OCI was established to ensure interoperability and portability across different container runtimes and platforms. </li>
</p>

<h4> CRI (Container Runtime Interface): </h4>
<p>

<li> CRI is a Kubernetes project that defines a standard interface between Kubernetes and container runtimes. </li>
<li> It allows Kubernetes to support different container runtimes without being tightly coupled to any specific implementation. </li>
<li> With CRI, Kubernetes components like kubelet can communicate with container runtimes via a standardized API.
CRI is designed to make it easier to integrate and switch  container runtimes within a Kubernetes cluster. </li> 

<h4> CRI-O: </h4>

<li> CRI-O is an implementation of the CRI that is lightweight and designed specifically for Kubernetes. </li>
<li> It is a container runtime that enables Kubernetes to directly interact with containers without the need for a full-fledged container orchestration platform. </li>
<li> CRI-O uses OCI-compliant container runtimes (such as runc) to create and run containers. </li>
<li> Unlike more comprehensive container runtimes like Docker, CRI-O focuses solely on the requirements of Kubernetes, making it simpler and more specialized. </li>
